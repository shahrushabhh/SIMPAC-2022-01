"The websites of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and other U.S. financial institutions suffered simultaneous outages due to a coordinated denial of service cyberattack in September 2012.

At the time, the media reported that U.S. intelligence believed the denial of service was in response to U.S. imposed economic sanctions to counter Iran’s nuclear program. Seven Iranian individuals linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were eventually indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2016 for their involvement in the incident. 

The denial of service attacks against U.S. banks is significant for two reasons. First, the size and scale of the attacks led the State Department to seek other countries’ assistance in taking down the compromised computers that were flooding the banks with junk traffic. Second, the attacks would indicate that Iran—if it was in fact using the attacks as retaliation for U.S. financial sanctions—was acting proportionally in its dispute with the United States.",Denial of service

Google was the only company that confirmed it was a victim and disclosed to the public that the Gmail accounts of certain Chinese human rights activists had been compromised. Google also publicly attributed the incident to China, something companies were reluctant to do for fear of jeopardizing their access to the Chinese market.  

The incident is viewed as a milestone in the recent history of cyber operations because it raised the profile of cyber operations as a tool for industrial espionage. It led Google to cease its operations in China, though it continues to operate a localized version of its search engine in Hong Kong.

Stuxnet was the first publicly known instance in which a cyber operation caused physical damage outside of a controlled testing environment. It demonstrated the potential effectiveness and value of a cyber weapon.
